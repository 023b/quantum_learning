Week 8 Notes: Quantum vs Classical Algorithms
Search Algorithms

Classical search: O(N) operations
Quantum search (Grover): O(âˆšN) operations
Example: 1 million items

Classical: ~1,000,000 operations
Quantum: ~1,000 operations (1000x faster)



Quantum Simulation

Classical: O(2^N) operations (exponential)
Quantum: O(N) operations (linear)
Example: 50-qubit simulation

Classical: ~10^15 operations (impossible)
Quantum: ~50 operations (tractable)



Other Quantum Advantages

Shor's algorithm: exponential speedup for factoring
HHL algorithm: exponential speedup for linear systems
Quantum Fourier Transform: exponential speedup for certain transformations

Speedup Origins

Superposition: evaluate multiple possibilities simultaneously
Interference: amplify correct answers, cancel wrong ones
Entanglement: correlations beyond classical probability

Current State

Most advantages theoretical
Need lower error rates and more qubits
