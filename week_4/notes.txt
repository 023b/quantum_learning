Week 4 Notes: Error Correction & IBM Quantum
Quantum Errors

Bit flip (X error): flips between |0⟩ and |1⟩
Phase flip (Z error): flips sign of |1⟩ component
Depolarizing: random X/Y/Z errors (total corruption)
Real quantum computers have ~5% error per gate

Error Correction Codes

Bit-flip code: encodes |0⟩→|000⟩, |1⟩→|111⟩
Phase-flip code: similar but in Hadamard basis
Shor code: protects against any single-qubit error
Uses majority voting to correct errors

Syndrome Measurement

Detects presence and location of errors
Doesn't collapse quantum information
Uses ancilla qubits for detection

IBM Quantum Access

Real quantum computers available through cloud
Queue times can be very long (hours)
Fewer qubits than simulation (currently <150)
Much higher error rates than simulation

Noise Modeling

Can simulate noise in Qiskit
Different types: bit-flip, phase-flip, depolarizing
Helps test error correction codes
