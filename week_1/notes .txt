# Week 1 Notes: Quantum Computing Basics

## Qubits vs Classical Bits
- Classical bits: only 0 OR 1
- Qubits: can be in superposition (kind of both 0 and 1 at once)
- Measuring a qubit forces it to pick just 0 or 1

## Superposition
- Created using the Hadamard (H) gate
- When measured, gives random results - about 50% 0s and 50% 1s
- This is where quantum randomness comes from

## Gates 
- H gate: creates superposition
- X gate: flips a qubit (like NOT gate)
- CNOT (CX) gate: flips second qubit only if first qubit is 1

## Quantum Circuits
- Sequence of gates applied to qubits
- Need to end with measurement to see results
- A circuit run many times gives statistical results

## Entanglement
- Bell state: simplest entangled state
- Created with H gate + CNOT gate
- When measured, both qubits always match (both 0 or both 1)
- Never get 01 or 10 outcomes - proves quantum weirdness

## Applications I Tried
- Quantum random number generator
- Quantum dice roller

## Qiskit Stuff
- QuantumCircuit: creates circuit with qubits
- AerSimulator: runs the simulation
- Sampler: collects results
- shots=1000: runs circuit 1000 times
