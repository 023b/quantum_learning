Week 7 Notes: Quantum vs Classical ML Benchmark
Performance Comparison

Classical SVM: 96% accuracy, very fast
Classical Neural Net: 93% accuracy, fast
Quantum Classifier: 75% accuracy, extremely slow

Theoretical Advantages

Quantum access to exponentially larger feature spaces
Potential quantum kernels with complex correlations
Ability to represent certain distributions more efficiently

Current Limitations

Noisy quantum hardware
Limited qubits (~50-100 currently)
Decoherence limits circuit depth
Training requires many circuit evaluations

Hardware Considerations

IBM Quantum: queue times of 3+ hours
Limited connectivity between qubits
Circuit transpilation adds depth
Measurement errors compound problems
