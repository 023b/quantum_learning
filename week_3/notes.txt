Week 3 Notes: Quantum Fourier Transform and Advanced Algorithms
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

Like classical Fourier transform but quantum
Transforms between "time" and "frequency" domains
Core building block for many quantum algorithms
Uses H gates and controlled phase rotations
My 3-qubit implementation seems to work but results are weird
Need to swap qubits at the end because of qubit ordering

Phase Estimation

Finds the "phase" of a quantum operation
Uses QFT as a key component
Created a simple example finding phase = 1/8
Results mostly show |001‚ü© (binary for 1/8)
This algorithm is used in Shor's factoring algorithm
Starting to see how QFT is useful

Quantum Teleportation

Transfers quantum state between qubits using entanglement
Needs classical communication + quantum entanglement
Bell state creates the quantum channel
Bell measurement collapses the state
Classical correction operations restore the state
Couldn't fully simulate with conditional operations

Challenges

Getting more complex - harder to understand what's happening
QFT math is confusing
Controlled phase rotations look simple but I don't get them
Teleportation conditional ops not working with new Qiskit

Cool Realizations

These algorithms have real uses in quantum computing
QFT is way faster than classical Fourier transform
Starting to see how quantum speedups happen
Teleportation shows how entanglement is useful
