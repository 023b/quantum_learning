Week 5 Notes: Quantum Machine Learning
Quantum ML Approaches

Quantum feature maps: encode classical data as quantum states
Variational quantum classifiers: trainable circuits
Quantum kernels: quantum version of SVM kernels

Quantum Encoding

Encode classical features into qubit rotations
Rx gates use angles to represent data values
Entanglement creates non-linear feature interactions
Measurement gives probability used for classification

Variational Circuits

Quantum version of neural network layers
Contains trainable parameters (rotation angles)
Alternating rotation and entanglement layers

Gradient Calculation

Need 2 circuit evaluations per parameter
No automatic differentiation (unlike PyTorch)
Makes training very computationally expensive

Datasets

Used moons dataset (two interleaved half-circles)
Need feature scaling to [0,2Ï€] for encoding in gates
Limited to low-dimensional data (few features)
